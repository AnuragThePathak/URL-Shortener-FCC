# [URL Shortener Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/url-shortener-microservice)

- This is my solution to the [URL Shortener Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/url-shortener-microservice) challenge in the freeCodeCamp Back End Development Certification.
- The challenge is to create a URL shortener microservice that takes in a URL as a parameter and returns a short URL.
- After generating the short URL, anyone can use the short URL to access the original URL when requested.
- I have also added docker to this project on my own.
