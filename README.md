# [URL Shortener Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/url-shortener-microservice)

This is my solution to the [URL Shortener Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/url-shortener-microservice) challenge in the freeCodeCamp Back End Development Certification.

I have also added docker to this project on my own.
